# groceries_vis
Fun project visualising my grocery purchases over a portion of my masters programme in London.

In this project I use Pandas for data organisation and Matplotlib for the initial data plotting. Plans are to learn some of Seaborn to beautify the data. Some general metrics (mean cost, frequency of each store visit, etc) will be provided as well.
